# Issue #004: CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Description
Set up a comprehensive Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality, automated testing, and streamlined deployment processes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for pull requests
- [ ] Implement automated testing pipeline (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Set up code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- [ ] Configure automated deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Add security scanning and dependency vulnerability checks
- [ ] Implement build caching and optimization
- [ ] Create deployment approval process for production

## Technical Requirements
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress, Supertest
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript compiler
- **Security**: Dependabot, CodeQL, Snyk
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/Azure/GCP
- **Monitoring**: Build status notifications

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflows
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Run type checking
        run: npm run type-check

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm run test:unit

      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration

      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e

      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: npm run test:coverage

      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy-staging:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: staging
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: |
          docker build -t care-demo-staging .
          docker push ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_URL }}/care-demo-staging
          # Deploy to staging environment

  deploy-production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    needs: deploy-staging
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          docker build -t care-demo-production .
          docker push ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_URL }}/care-demo-production
          # Deploy to production environment
```

### Security Scanning
```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 1" # Weekly
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
        with:
          languages: javascript, typescript

      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2

      - name: Run Snyk security scan
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

## Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage required
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% test pass rate required
- **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Build time under 10 minutes
- **Linting**: Zero ESLint errors

## Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload
- **Staging**: Automated deployment from develop branch
- **Production**: Manual approval required for main branch
- **Feature Branches**: Automated testing only

## Monitoring and Notifications
- **Build Status**: GitHub status checks and badges
- **Slack Integration**: Notifications for build failures
- **Email Alerts**: Critical deployment notifications
- **Dashboard**: Build metrics and deployment history

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CI pipeline runs on all pull requests
- [ ] All quality gates are enforced
- [ ] Automated deployment to staging works
- [ ] Security scanning is integrated
- [ ] Build caching improves performance
- [ ] Monitoring and notifications are configured
- [ ] Documentation is updated with deployment procedures

## Priority: High
## Estimated Effort: 6-8 hours
## Labels: ci-cd, devops, automation
