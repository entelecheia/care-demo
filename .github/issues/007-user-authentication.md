# Issue #007: User Authentication and Profile Management

## Description

Implement user authentication system with profile setup, role management, and session handling for the CARE demo platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create user registration and login forms
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication flow
- [ ] Build user profile setup wizard
- [ ] Add role-based access control
- [ ] Create session management and persistence
- [ ] Implement password security and validation
- [ ] Add user profile editing functionality

## Technical Requirements

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, rate limiting
- **Validation**: Form validation with error messages
- **Storage**: Secure token storage (httpOnly cookies)
- **Roles**: Policy Maker, Citizen, Expert, Admin

## User Flow Implementation

### Initial Setup Flow

1. **Welcome Screen**: Platform introduction and demo scenario
2. **Profile Setup**: Name, role, and region selection
3. **Authentication**: Login or guest mode for demo
4. **Dashboard**: Personalized view based on role

### Role-Based Features

- **Policy Maker**: Full access to analysis tools and reports
- **Citizen**: Community feedback and discussion access
- **Expert**: Advanced analysis and data export
- **Admin**: User management and system configuration

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

- **LoginForm**: Email/password authentication
- **ProfileSetup**: Initial user configuration
- **RoleSelector**: Role selection dropdown
- **RegionSelector**: Geographic area selection
- **UserMenu**: Profile and logout functionality

### Backend Services

- **AuthService**: JWT generation and validation
- **UserService**: User CRUD operations
- **RoleService**: Role and permission management
- **SessionService**: Token refresh and invalidation

### Security Features

- Password strength validation
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- CSRF protection
- Secure cookie configuration
- Input sanitization

## API Endpoints

```
POST /auth/register
POST /auth/login
POST /auth/refresh
POST /auth/logout
GET /auth/me
PUT /auth/profile
GET /auth/roles
```

## Demo Simplification

For MVP demo purposes:

- Pre-populate with demo user accounts
- Skip email verification
- Allow guest mode for quick demo
- Pre-configure Travis County scenario

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Users can register and login successfully
- [ ] JWT tokens are generated and validated
- [ ] Role-based access control works
- [ ] Profile setup wizard completes successfully
- [ ] Session persistence works across browser refreshes
- [ ] Security measures prevent common attacks
- [ ] Demo mode works without authentication

## Priority: Medium

## Estimated Effort: 8-10 hours

## Labels: authentication, security, frontend
