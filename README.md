# CARE Demo Platform

A comprehensive web platform for analyzing and simulating community acceptance of policy interventions, built with React, NestJS, and PostgreSQL.

## üéØ Overview

The CARE (Community Acceptance Research and Evaluation) Demo Platform is an interactive web application that enables policy makers to:

- **Analyze** current community acceptance levels using quantitative metrics
- **Simulate** the impact of policy interventions on community sentiment
- **Visualize** changes in community concerns across 5 key categories
- **Evaluate** policy effectiveness through structured feedback
- **Generate** comprehensive reports for stakeholder communication

### Demo Scenario: Wind Farm Development in Travis County, Texas

The platform demonstrates its capabilities through a realistic scenario: analyzing community acceptance for a proposed wind farm development in Travis County, Texas. Users can explore baseline community sentiment, test various policy interventions, and see how different approaches affect community acceptance.
